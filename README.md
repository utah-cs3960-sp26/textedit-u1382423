To begin I made a very specific request for what I want as well as clearly displaying what I don't want. I wanted to have the AI build as much as possible in one request. This was decided because my experience has shown that the more layers added onto the AI, the more likely it is to put itself in a hole. If I didn't like how it approached the initial query, I would steer course and try again. Fortunately, it nailed it. The design was simple and user friendly for the most part, and simple functionality worked. I wanted to see if the AI could debug itself so I had it set up simple tests with pytest. Initially, the coverage was limited however I ensured it was modified to cover as much of the codebase as possible. I noticed some sytax features it naturally built, so I have it expand those features for different languages. I tested unique cases with nesting and keywords, and thus far I have not discovered any issues. It has struggled to understand some user inconveniences. For example, opening and closing files repeatedly inserts pop ups which ask to save the existing file. This isn't an "error" so it has a hard time understanding what I want. All in all, I am very impressed with its ability to perform complex tasks, but as expected, it seems to struggle with layering on data bases, and human centered inconveniences.

    What about the feature works and doesn't work
The opening and saving of files was a feature that the AI struggled with. When a file was saved, if the user did anything other than instantly open a new file, the text editor would ask to save it again. This would be a frustrating bug for a user because upon doing almost any action to open or close the file, it would ask to save first, even if it was already saved. It has been fixed to only ask to save if leaving an unsaved file.

    Brag about the feature a little bit -- tell us something about how you approached it, how you solved it, or some interesting bit of your software architecture.
In order to approach this problem, I tested every possible case in which I would be leaving a file (opening a new or saved file, closing the program, canceling and open before opening a file, ...) and listed the results. I then input very specific example cases of when this issue would arrise before detailing how I want the text editor to respond. Interestingly, Qt has a saved/edited file feature that the AI didn't consider until I specified my experience. The AI incorporated this and all the error cases have been resolved.

    How does this feature fit into the modular structure of your editor?
This feature fit really well into the structure of the editor because it was already built into Qt. This means that the handling if this feature is treated fairly independently of the rest of the editor.

    For the parts that work, explain how you know that they work as intended. other words, explain what kind of tests you are using to validate the functionality of your editor.
I tried extensive cases manually to try and reproduce the error in ways that even a human would likely never encounter. For example, I tested many combinations of requests (open/save/undo/redo/new...) as well as canceling the requests or modifying the content. Thus far, I have not found any similar user inconveniences.
