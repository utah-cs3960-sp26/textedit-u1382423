To begin I made a very specific request for what I want as well as clearly displaying what I don't want. I wanted to have the AI build as much as possible in one request. This was decided because my experience has shown that the more layers added onto the AI, the more likely it is to put itself in a hole. If I didn't like how it approached the initial query, I would steer course and try again. Fortunately, it nailed it. The design was simple and user friendly for the most part, and simple functionality worked. I wanted to see if the AI could debug itself so I had it set up simple tests with pytest. Initially, the coverage was limited however I ensured it was modified to cover as much of the codebase as possible. I noticed some sytax features it naturally built, so I have it expand those features for different languages. I tested unique cases with nesting and keywords, and thus far I have not discovered any issues. It has struggled to understand some user inconveniences. For example, opening and closing files repeatedly inserts pop ups which ask to save the existing file. This isn't an "error" so it has a hard time understanding what I want. All in all, I am very impressed with its ability to perform complex tasks, but as expected, it seems to struggle with layering on data bases, and human centered inconveniences.
